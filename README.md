# r2css

[Online tool](http://r2css.netlify.app/) that converts react inline styling to css style. Yep, pretty straightforward and simple.

### Motivation to build this

Sometimes when I am dead lazy and just want to quickly check how a component looks, I end up writing some inline styling in React. But we all know it's not ideal to keep styling in the component unless absolutely necessary. 

So on these particularly lazy days, I need to spend time moving my inline styling to their respective css files. And believe me when I tell you this, it is absolutely a pain to manually correct the camel case to kebab case, remove all those damn quotes and add semicolon.

**Enter, r2css**

Stupid name, I know. But hey, feel free to use it if you are one of the rare creatures who codes like me.


Fin.
